<h1 align="center">FabricMod 1.20.1</h1>
<p align="center"><strong>A Minecraft mod made for fabric client focused on improvements to the building aspect of Minecraft.</strong>
<br/>

<h2>About</h2>
<strong>This is a Minecraft mod which aims to add more options for builders in Minecraft. It includes custom blocks and tools which enhance the building experience. I built this project because I am a longtime enjoyer of Minecraft building. Unfortunately. however, there are many features that aren't in the game that would improve the experience for most players. </strong><br/>


<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
<strong> My goal with this project is to implement some features that I wished was in the game. This means things like vertical half-slabs, custom blocks and custom tools that improve placing, and working in tandem with other mods to optimize building. Some non-goals are to implementing different world generation or new mobs. I only wish to improve the building aspects of the game with this mod.

 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
<strong>My sprint goal is to potentially have the mod be multiplayer compatatble. This means that I would have to get this mod to work on the server side as well as the client side. This would mean that I would have to create </strong><br/>

<h2>Key learnings</h2>
<strong>This project was truly a learning experience. First of all, this project taught me about the importance of proper heirachy and structure in the file management. There were times when I had to contantly call back to certain pieces of code and it wouldt fail because I didn't set up my heirachy properly. I've also learnt about the very basics of Gradle, utilizing it to link my code to the actual game client. I am still new to Gradle as so I have much to learn, however, this was a first step towards developing a deeper understanding of Gradle down the line. A lesson learnt from this project is having to stay motivated. Towards the end of the project, I felt motivation decline as a lack of progress towards figuring out my sprint goal as well as some external factors led me to be unable to complete my sprint goal in time. From this, I understand that these sorts of excuses do not validate my lack of motivation or drive to complete that final goal and that I should have kept on trying harder.   </strong><br/>


<h2>Running your project</h2>
<strong>This would first require quite a few things. First of all, the person running this must have a Minecraft account. Obviously. Next, they should download the code and open it up in a IDE that can run Gradle. For me, I used the Intellij community version which can run Gradle. Once the files are open, the player needs to find the option to run the client file thorugh Gradle. This should launch an instance of Minecraft which has the mods loaded into the client. </strong><br/>

<h2>Misc.</h2>
This project was a great experience overall. I had a lot of fun messing around in Minecraft, trying things out and messing around with all of the possible functions such as creating random mass weapons of destruction. I think this project is very accessible, there is a lot of online documentation which makes it really easy to get started. Overall, I think this was a fun learning experience and I definitely have interest in trying to both continue this mod (figure out multiplayer) and create some new ones with focuses on other things like combat or new biome generations.
