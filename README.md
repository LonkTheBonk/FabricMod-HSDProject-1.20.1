<h1 align="center">FabricMod 1.20.1</h1>
<p align="center"><strong>A Minecraft mod made for fabric client focused on improvements to the building aspect of Minecraft.</strong>
<br/>

<h2>About</h2>
<strong>This is a Minecraft mod which aims to add more options for builders in Minecraft. It includes custom blocks and tools which enhance the building experience. I built this project because I am a longtime enjoyer of Minecraft building. Unfortunately. however, there are many features that aren't in the game that would improve the experience for most players. </strong><br/>


<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
<strong> My goal with this project is to implement some features that I wished was in the game. This means things like vertical half-slabs, custom blocks and custom tools that improve placing, and working in tandem with other mods to optimize building. Some non-goals are to implementing different world generation or new mobs. I only wish to improve the building aspects of the game with this mod.

 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
<strong>My sprint goal is to potentially have the mod be multiplayer compatatble. This means that I would have to get this mod to work on the server side as well as the client side.</strong><br/>

<h2>Key learnings</h2>
<strong>This project was truly a learning experience. First of all, this project taught me about the importance of proper heirachy and structure in the file management. There were times when I had to contantly call back to certain pieces of code and </strong><br/>
So... what did you learn? (start this, but **come back to it at the end of the sprint**)
